README
======

This directory contains a set of examples to familiarize yourself with different modeling setups and for testing purposes.
The sections include:
- :point_right: **applications/**: user examples to familiarize yourself with different modeling setups

- **benchmarks/**: examples for testing purposes and validation of the code

- **real_world/**: examples dealing with simulation setups from realistic locations

- **reproducible_study/**: simulation setups to reproduce published results


Each example requires a `Par_file`, `SOURCE`, and either a file of interfaces OR an external mesh.
The examples can be run in the example directory, using the processing script:
```
./run_this_example.sh
```

If you're interested in how to setup and run a simple SPECFEM2D simulation,
we suggest to look at the **applications/simple_topography_and_also_a_simple_fluid_layer/** example.

Please **consider submitting your own example** to this package!
