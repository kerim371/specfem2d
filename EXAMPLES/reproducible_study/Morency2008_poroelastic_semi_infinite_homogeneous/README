This default example creates an internal mesh with a homogeneous poroelastic medium, with an inviscid fluid.
The model parameters are given by Morency & Tromp (2008), Table 1.


TO RUN:

0. Read the user manual in SPECFEM2D/doc/manual_SPECFEM2D.pdf

1. in SPECFEM2D root directory, configure, e.g. for a serial calculation,
   ./configure FC=gfortran

2. compile:
   make all

3. cd EXAMPLES/poroelastic_infinite_homogeneous

4. execute script to run mesher and solver for P-SV case:
   ./run_this_example.sh

5. check out the output files in the local directory OUTPUT_FILES/

   The seismograms should compare to Fig.4 in Morency and Tromp, Geophys. J. Int. (2008) 175, 301-345.

Note about source time function:

  For Fig.4 in Moreny2008, the source time function is a Gaussian with a dominant frequency of 30 Hz.
  In SPECFEM2D, the Gaussian (time_function_type == 3) is defined as the second integral of the Ricker wavelet
  to be able to apply the USE_TRICK_FOR_BETTER_PRESSURE feature. This leads to a negative sign in front of the Gaussian,
  i.e., the Gaussian source time function values are stricly <= 0.0. In Morency2008, the Gaussian is defined with positive
  values, we therefore flip the sign of the source amplification factor in DATA/SOURCE to match the trace solution.
