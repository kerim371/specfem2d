This simulation uses a visco-acoustic simulation, thus setting attenuation ATTENUATION_VISCOACOUSTIC = .true.

The source here uses an amplification factor of 4* PI * vp**2 = 4 * PI * (2000)**2 = 50264000.0
This is due to a factor difference between the source definitions in Carcione.

The convention used by Carcione in his 1988 paper is to use a source of amplitude 4 * PI * cp^2, 
while in SPECFEM it is to have amplitude 1.

Note: The reference code provided in attenuation_viscoacoustic_NSLS_3/ folder is not correcting for this.
      While the code provided in check_absolute_amplitude_of_pressure_source_seismograms_acoustic/analytical_solution_viscoacoustic_Carcione_version1.f90
      is dividing the source by 4 * PI * cp^2 to get the right amplitude directly.

Note about source time function:
  This example uses the feature USE_TRICK_FOR_BETTER_PRESSURE in DATA/Par_file to compute the pressure trace as a second-order accurate solution.
  With this trick, pressure relates to the acoustic potential instead of potential_dot_dot by taking the second derivative of the source time function.
  In SPECFEM2D, the Gaussian wavelet (time_function_type == 3) is defined such that its second derivative becomes the Ricker wavelet. Thus, you will see
  a Ricker wavelet as source time function in OUTPUT_FILES/plot_source_time_function.txt and not a Gaussian.
