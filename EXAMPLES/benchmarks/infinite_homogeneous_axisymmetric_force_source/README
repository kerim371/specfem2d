This example runs an axisymmetric example in an infinite homogeneous elastic medium, for benchmarking against an analytical 3D solution.
The domain defined is physically the meridional 2D shape of a axisymmetric 3D domain. The source is a vertical point force on the symmetry axis.

To run the example, type:

  ./run_this_example.sh

in this directory.

The results are stored in OUTPUT_FILES/ and the seismograms created can be compared with those in the REF_SEIS/ folder.
